## Installation:

Add

    #define TAPPING_TOGGLE  1
    #define TAPPING_TERM    100

to `planck/config.h`

or else the default number of taps is 5. I also found that that tapping interval was too long at 200ms, so I set it to 100. I wish there were a cleaner way to set this, but it doesn't look like there is.

## Notable changes:

1. I was used to having my capslock mapped to backspace, so you'll see my backspace in a similar position
2. I was also used to having Command immediately to the left of the spacebar, so I moved the lower and raise buttons
3. The key immediately to the right of the spacebar is a return, which I find easier to hit than with my pinky
4. Holding the layer buttons switch temporarily, tapping them goes to that layer
  a. If you are ON a function layer, you can't temporarily switch to another layer, sorry. You can still go to it by tapping, though
5. The right bottom corner will always return you to the default layer

## TODO

1. MOAR LAYERS!
2. Macros!
